# class declaration 
class my_class:
    def display(self):

         self.x=x

# why use self:
# self refers to the current instance of the class.
# It is used to access instance variables and methods within the class.
# It is a convention in Python and makes it explicit which objectâ€™s data you are working with in methods.
